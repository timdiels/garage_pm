A basic cross-platform project management tool with a focus on one-man projects
with no need for resource management.

Out of scope:

- Resources. We assume a single person works on the project and no resources
  need to be assigned. Garage PM has no clue what resources are.

## Installation

- Install PyQt 5.x.x or later with your package manager or manually
- Use `python setup.py`
- run with `garage-pm`
